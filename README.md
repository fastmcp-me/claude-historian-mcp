## install

Requirements:

> [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

**From shell:**

```bash
claude mcp add claude-historian-mcp -- npx claude-historian-mcp
```

**From inside Claude** (restart required):

```
Add this to our global mcp config: npx claude-historian-mcp

Install this mcp: https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp
```

**From any manually configurable `mcp.json`**: (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-historian-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["claude-historian-mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

That's it; there is **no `npm install` required** as there are no external dependencies or local databases, only search algorithms.

However, in the unlikely event that you pull the wrong package / `npx` registry is out of date, you can force resolution issues in certain environments with:

```bash
npm install -g claude-historian-mcp
```

> **📦 renamed:** This project was renamed from `claude-historian` to `claude-historian-mcp`. Existing users should update your install command and MCP config args to `claude-historian-mcp`.

## methodology

How [claude-historian](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp) [works](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/tree/master/src):

```
"docker auth" query
      |
      ├─> Parallel Processing (search.ts:157): 15 projects × 10 files concurrently
      |   • Promise.allSettled for 6x speed improvement
      |   • Early termination when sufficient results found
      |   • Enhanced file coverage with comprehensive patterns
      |
      ├─> Enhanced Classification (search.ts:582): implementation → boost tool workflows
      |   • Workflow detection for tool sequences (Edit → Read → Bash)
      |   • Semantic boundary preservation (never truncate mid-function)
      |   • Claude-optimized formatting with rich metadata
      |
      ├─> Smart Ranking (search.ts:637):
      |   • "Edit workflow (7x successful)" (2h ago) *****
      |   • "Docker auth with context paths" (yesterday) ****
      |   • "Container debugging patterns" (last week) ***
      |
      └─> Return Claude Code optimized results
```

**Core optimizations:**

- [parallel processing](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search.ts#L157): `Promise.allSettled` for 6x speed improvement across projects and files
- [workflow detection](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search.ts#L1010): Captures tool sequences like "Edit → Read → Bash" patterns
- [enhanced file matching](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search.ts#L694): Comprehensive path variations with case-insensitive matching
- [intelligent deduplication](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search-helpers.ts#L40): Content-based deduplication preserving highest-scoring results
- [intelligent truncation](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/formatter.ts#L46): Never truncates mid-function or mid-error
- [Claude-optimized formatting](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/formatter.ts#L15): Rich metadata with technical content prioritization

**Search strategies:**

- **[JSON streaming parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming)** ([parseJsonlFile](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/parser.ts#L16)): Reads Claude Code conversation files on-demand without full deserialization
- **[LRU caching](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)>)** ([messageCache](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search.ts#L13)): In-memory cache with intelligent eviction for frequently accessed conversations
- **[TF-IDF inspired scoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)** ([calculateRelevanceScore](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search.ts#L637)): Term frequency scoring with document frequency weighting for relevance
- **[Query classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_classification)** ([classifyQueryType](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search.ts#L582)): Naive Bayes-style classification (error/implementation/analysis/general) with adaptive limits
- **[Edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance)** ([calculateQuerySimilarity](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search-helpers.ts#L157)): Fuzzy matching for technical terms and typo tolerance
- **[Exponential time decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay)** (getTimeRangeFilter): Recent messages weighted higher with configurable half-life
- **[Parallel file processing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled)** ([getErrorSolutions](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search.ts#L882)): Concurrent project scanning with early termination for 0.8s response times
- **[Workflow pattern recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_pattern_mining)** ([getToolPatterns](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search.ts#L1010)): Detects tool usage sequences and related workflows for learning
- **[Enhanced file context](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)>)** ([findFileContext](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search.ts#L694)): Multi-project search with comprehensive path matching
- **[Content-aware truncation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_segmentation)** ([smartTruncation](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/formatter.ts#L46)): Intelligent content boundaries over arbitrary character limits
- **[Technical content prioritization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction)** ([BeautifulFormatter](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/formatter.ts#L15)): Code blocks, errors, and file paths get full preservation
- **[Query similarity clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis)** ([findSimilarQueries](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp/blob/master/src/search.ts#L811)): Semantic expansion and pattern grouping for related questions

**File access:**

- Reads from: `~/.claude/conversations/`
- Zero persistent storage or indexing
- Never leaves your machine

## performance

See [PERF.md](./PERF.md) for benchmarks, optimization history, and quality scores.

**Current (v1.0.2)**: 4/7 tools at ≥4.0/5, targeting all 7. Focus: structured JSON output for Claude Code consumption.

## development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vvkmnn/claude-historian-mcp && cd claude-historian
npm install && npm run build
npm test
```

**Package requirements:**

- **Node.js**: >=20.0.0 (ES modules support)
- **npm**: >=10.0.0 (package-lock v3)
- **Runtime**: Only `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dependency
- **Zero external dependencies** for production deployment
- **Optimized**: 50% token reduction with parallel processing

**Development workflow:**

```bash
npm run build          # TypeScript compilation with executable permissions
npm run dev            # Watch mode with tsc --watch
npm run start          # Run the MCP server directly
npm run lint           # ESLint code quality checks
npm run lint:fix       # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format         # Prettier formatting (src/)
npm run format:check   # Check formatting without changes
npm run type-check     # TypeScript validation without emit
npm run test           # Run help command + type check
npm run prepublishOnly # Pre-publish validation (build + lint + format:check)
```

**Git hooks (via Husky):**

- **pre-commit**: Auto-formats staged `.ts` files with Prettier and ESLint
- **pre-push**: Runs full validation (format, lint, type-check, build) before push

Contributing:

- Please fork the repository and create feature branches
- Test with large conversation histories before submitting PRs
- Follow TypeScript strict mode and [MCP protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification) standards

Learn from examples:

- [Official MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) for reference implementations
- [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) for best practices
- [Creating Node.js modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-node-js-modules) - NPM package development guide

## desktop

**Note:** Claude Desktop stores conversations server-side, not locally. The local LevelDB files (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`) contain only session tokens, UI preferences, and Intercom state - not conversation content. Claude Desktop support is also blocked by [LevelDB locks](https://github.com/Level/level#open) and [Electron sandboxing](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/sandbox).

This means **local history search for Claude Desktop is not currently possible**. This project focuses on **Claude Code**, which stores full conversation history locally in `~/.claude/projects/`.

You may get some Claude Desktop from Claude Code, but **only when the Claude app is closed**. Furthermore A DXT package and build is available for future compatibility; further investigations are ongoing. Feel free to test with it.
